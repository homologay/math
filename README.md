# Math 

There are three folders in this repository. 

```educational_materials``` is for students taking math classes. They're organized by subject. It's likely of limited interest otherwise. This is my original writing and should not be used without crediting me. 

```expository``` explores advanced concepts for a general audience. This is my original writing and should not be used without crediting me.

```textbook_solutions``` contains solutions and notes from some books I read. You may use them for your homework. My interests tend towards algebra. This is what's on my shelf:  

*Introduction to Commutative Algebra* by Atiyah and MacDonald

*Category Theory in Context* by Riehl

*Homotopical Topology* by Fomenko and Fuchs 

*Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry* by Eisenbud

*Algebraic Extensions of Fields* by McCarthy

*Topics in Algebra* by Herstein 

*Abstract Algebra* by Dummit and Foote

*Categories for the Working Mathematician* by Mac Lane

*An Introduction to Homological Algebra* by Weibel

*On Numbers and Games* by Conway

*Principles of Mathematical Analysis* by Rudin

*Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces* by Do Carmo

*A First Look at Rigorous Probability Theory* by Rosenthal

*Calculus on Manifolds* by Spivak
