Time for math. 

Here are some textbooks on my bookshelf that I like to read sometimes. I might post some problem solutions from these books here. 

*Introduction to Commutative Algebra* by Atiyah and MacDonald
*Category Theory in Context* by Riehl
*Homotopical Topology* by Fomenko and Fuchs 
*Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry* by Eisenbud
*Algebraic Extensions of Fields* by McCarthy
*Topics in Algebra* by Herstein 
*Abstract Algebra* by Dummit and Foote
*Categories for the Working Mathematician* by Mac Lane
*An Introduction to Homological Algebra* by Weibel

I recommend trying to solve the problems before looking at the solutions (oh, boo! I know...!)
